##Resources Used

### EJS

 [EJS](https://ejs.co/) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.
 In this app it has been used as a rendering medium for the fron-end


### Express-Validators

 [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/index.html) is a set of [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) middlewares that wraps [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) validator and sanitizer functions.
